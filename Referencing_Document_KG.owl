Through information sharing and coordination with public health departments, educational agencies and institutions can help protect their schools and communities. 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(1)(); 34 C-F.R. §§ 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36. While FERPA generally permits the nonconsensual disclosure of properly designated “directory information” (e.g., name, address, phone number, grade level) when parents or eligible students have not opted out of such a disclosure, it does not permit an educational agency or institution to disclose “directory information” on students that is linked to non-directory information (such as information regarding a student’s illness). For example if a student with COVID-19 is a wrestler and has been in direct and close contact with other students who are on the team or who are in the school and have higher health risks, school officials may determine it necessary to disclose the identity of the diagnosed student to the parents of the other students. If the parent or eligible student will not provide written consent for the disclosure of the PII, then the educational agency or institution may not make the disclosure unless it has determined that there is an applicable exception to the general requirement of consent that permits the disclosure, such as if a health or safety emergency exists and the PII is disclosed to an appropriate party whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.</Referencing_Document_KG:Extracted_Policy_Summary>

The guidance emphasizes that, under the medical emergency exception at 42 CFR 2.51, a Part 2 program or lawful holder may disclose Part 2-protected information without a patient’s consent if the provider determines a bona fide medical emergency exists for purpose of providing needed treatment to patients. Breaches: The HIPAA breach notification requirements and penalties apply to breaches of Part 2-protected information. OCR has stated that it will issue a notice to the public when it is no longer exercising its enforcement discretion.

Further, covered entities, seeing what OCR did with the Business Associate waiver, will likely revise their contracts at the next opportunity to flatly prohibit uses and disclosures not expressly approved by the covered entities, to require advance notice, or to give the covered entities veto power. So does the ability of OCR to issue administrative HIPAA waivers. Giving the Secretary unrestricted authority to waive any or all provisions of HIPAA would be a poor choice, especially seeing how poorly the Office of Civil Rights acted during the COVID-19 emergency.">COVID-19 and HIPAA HHS’s Troubled Approach to Waiving Privacy and Security Rules for the Pandemic By Robert Gellman and Pam Dixon eptember 16, WORLD PRIVACY FORUM ©©</Referencing_Document_KG:Extracted_Policy_Summary>
